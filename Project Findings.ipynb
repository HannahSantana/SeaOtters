    "2. Hurricanes (tropical cyclones) appear to have been increasing in frequency and in cost. 2005 saw the largest, most damaging and most fatal of Hurricanes but the years following saw a number of damaging hurricanes. \n",
    "3. Droughts have decreased in severity which leads me to believe that now technology exists to remedy some of the consequences of droughts\n",
    "4. Tropical Cyclones cost the most by far which suggests that the increase in costs can likely be attributed to increasing population and infrastructure in areas that are hit the hardest by hurricanes\n"
